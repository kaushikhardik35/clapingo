Hi this is a n API through which students and teachers can register and students can mark their teachers as favourite and remove from favourite !!
To see how it works , Download the code , go the folder and run npm i command..
and then start the server using app.js file !!
Now go to localhost:3000 on your browser aur send api request to respective links you can get from app.js file
